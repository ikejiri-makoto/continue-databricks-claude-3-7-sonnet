// Set correct reference path to core type extensions
/// <reference path="../../../../types/databricks-extensions.d.ts" />

// This file provides a reference to the core module type extensions.
// All Databricks-specific type extensions are defined in core/llm/types/databricks-extensions.d.ts,
// and this file ensures proper reference to those extensions.

// The benefit of this approach is that it maintains a clear separation between
// type definitions and their references, while ensuring TypeScript can properly
// validate and extend core types throughout the codebase.
